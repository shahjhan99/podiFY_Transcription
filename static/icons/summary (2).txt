**Title: My First Umrah Experience: A Journey of Faith and Self-Discovery**

The narrator, a 19-year-old who had recently converted to Islam, shares their experience of performing Umrah for the first time in Saudi Arabia. Despite initial hesitation due to business commitments, the narrator's friend convinced them to prioritize their faith and perform the pilgrimage. As they prepared for Umrah, they donned the traditional white sheets, known as Ihram, and felt a sense of safety and protection. During the journey to Mecca, they recited prayers and chants, feeling a deep sense of peace and connection to their faith. Upon arriving in Mecca, the narrator was struck by the surreal experience of being in the holy city, having grown up in a conservative town in North Idaho. As they approached the Kaaba, they recited a Dua, keeping their eyes down until their friend instructed them to look up and behold the sacred site. The narrator's experience was marked by a sense of wonder, gratitude, and spiritual growth, highlighting the importance of prioritizing one's faith and embracing the journey of self-discovery.
